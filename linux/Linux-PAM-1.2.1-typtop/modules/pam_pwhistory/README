pam_pwhistory — PAM module to remember last passwords

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

This module saves the last passwords for each user in order to force password
change history and keep the user from alternating between the same password too
frequently.

This module does not work together with kerberos. In general, it does not make
much sense to use this module in conjunction with NIS or LDAP, since the old
passwords are stored on the local machine and are not available on another
machine for password history checking.

OPTIONS

debug

    Turns on debugging via syslog(3).

use_authtok

    When password changing enforce the module to use the new password provided
    by a previously stacked password module (this is used in the example of the
    stacking of the pam_cracklib module documented below).

enforce_for_root

    If this option is set, the check is enforced for root, too.

remember=N

    The last N passwords for each user are saved in /etc/security/opasswd. The
    default is 10. Value of 0 makes the module to keep the existing contents of
    the opasswd file unchanged.

retry=N

    Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1.

authtok_type=STRING

    See pam_get_authtok(3) for more details.

EXAMPLES

An example password section would be:

#%PAM-1.0
password     required       pam_pwhistory.so
password     required       pam_unix.so        use_authtok


In combination with pam_cracklib:

#%PAM-1.0
password     required       pam_cracklib.so    retry=3
password     required       pam_pwhistory.so   use_authtok
password     required       pam_unix.so        use_authtok
