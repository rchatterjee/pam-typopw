pam_exec — PAM module which calls an external command

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_exec is a PAM module that can be used to run an external command.

The child's environment is set to the current PAM environment list, as returned
by pam_getenvlist(3) In addition, the following PAM items are exported as
environment variables: PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER, PAM_SERVICE, PAM_TTY, PAM_USER and
PAM_TYPE, which contains one of the module types: account, auth, password,
open_session and close_session.

Commands called by pam_exec need to be aware of that the user can have controll
over the environment.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

expose_authtok

    During authentication the calling command can read the password from stdin
    (3). Only first PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE bytes of a password are provided to the
    command.

log=file

    The output of the command is appended to file

type=type

    Only run the command if the module type matches the given type.

stdout

    Per default the output of the executed command is written to /dev/null.
    With this option, the stdout output of the executed command is redirected
    to the calling application. It's in the responsibility of this application
    what happens with the output. The log option is ignored.

quiet

    Per default pam_exec.so will echo the exit status of the external command
    if it fails. Specifying this option will suppress the message.

seteuid

    Per default pam_exec.so will execute the external command with the real
    user ID of the calling process. Specifying this option means the command is
    run with the effective user ID.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/passwd to rebuild the NIS database after
each local password change:

        password optional pam_exec.so seteuid /usr/bin/make -C /var/yp


This will execute the command

make -C /var/yp

with effective user ID.
