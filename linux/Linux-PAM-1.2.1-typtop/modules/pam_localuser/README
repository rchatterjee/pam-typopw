pam_localuser — require users to be listed in /etc/passwd

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_localuser is a PAM module to help implementing site-wide login policies,
where they typically include a subset of the network's users and a few accounts
that are local to a particular workstation. Using pam_localuser and pam_wheel
or pam_listfile is an effective way to restrict access to either local users
and/or a subset of the network's users.

This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and a very short awk
script invoked by cron, but it's common enough to have been separated out.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

file=/path/passwd

    Use a file other than /etc/passwd.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/su to allow only local users in group
wheel to use su.

account required pam_wheel.so
