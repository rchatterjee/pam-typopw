pam_ftp — PAM module for anonymous access module

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_ftp is a PAM module which provides a pluggable anonymous ftp mode of
access.

This module intercepts the user's name and password. If the name is ftp or 
anonymous, the user's password is broken up at the @ delimiter into a PAM_RUSER
and a PAM_RHOST part; these pam-items being set accordingly. The username (
PAM_USER) is set to ftp. In this case the module succeeds. Alternatively, the
module sets the PAM_AUTHTOK item with the entered password and fails.

This module is not safe and easily spoofable.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

ignore

    Pay no attention to the email address of the user (if supplied).

ftp=XXX,YYY,...

    Instead of ftp or anonymous, provide anonymous login to the comma separated
    list of users: XXX,YYY,.... Should the applicant enter one of these
    usernames the returned username is set to the first in the list: XXX.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/ftpd to handle ftp style anonymous login:

#
# ftpd; add ftp-specifics. These lines enable anonymous ftp over
#       standard UN*X access (the listfile entry blocks access to
#       users listed in /etc/ftpusers)
#
auth    sufficient  pam_ftp.so
auth    required    pam_unix.so use_first_pass
auth    required    pam_listfile.so \
           onerr=succeed item=user sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers
