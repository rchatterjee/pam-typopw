.SH "NAME"
pam_group \- PAM module for group access
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpam_group\&.so\fR\ 'u
\fBpam_group\&.so\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the authentication module) to the user\&. Such memberships are based on the service they are applying for\&.
.PP
By default rules for group memberships are taken from config file
/etc/security/group\&.conf\&.
.PP
This module\*(Aqs usefulness relies on the file\-systems accessible to the user\&. The point being that once granted the membership of a group, the user may attempt to create a
\fBsetgid\fR
binary with a restricted group ownership\&. Later, when the user is not given membership to this group, they can recover group membership with the precompiled binary\&. The reason that the file\-systems that the user has access to are so significant, is the fact that when a system is mounted
\fInosuid\fR
the user is unable to create or execute such a binary file\&. For this module to provide any level of security, all file\-systems that the user has write access to should be mounted
\fInosuid\fR\&.
.PP
The pam_group module functions in parallel with the
/etc/group
file\&. If the user is granted any groups based on the behavior of this module, they are granted
\fIin addition\fR
to those entries
/etc/group
(or equivalent)\&.
