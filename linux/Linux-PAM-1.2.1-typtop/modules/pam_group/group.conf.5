.SH "NAME"
group.conf \- configuration file for the pam_group module
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it grants group memberships (in the credential setting phase of the authentication module) to the user\&. Such memberships are based on the service they are applying for\&.
.PP
For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly formatted
/etc/security/group\&.conf
file present\&. White spaces are ignored and lines maybe extended with \*(Aq\e\*(Aq (escaped newlines)\&. Text following a \*(Aq#\*(Aq is ignored to the end of the line\&.
.PP
The syntax of the lines is as follows:
.PP
\fIservices\fR;\fIttys\fR;\fIusers\fR;\fItimes\fR;\fIgroups\fR
.PP
The first field, the
\fIservices\fR
field, is a logic list of PAM service names that the rule applies to\&.
.PP
The second field, the
\fItty\fR
field, is a logic list of terminal names that this rule applies to\&.
.PP
The third field, the
\fIusers\fR
field, is a logic list of users, or a UNIX group, or a netgroup of users to whom this rule applies\&. Group names are preceded by a \*(Aq%\*(Aq symbol, while netgroup names are preceded by a \*(Aq@\*(Aq symbol\&.
.PP
For these items the simple wildcard \*(Aq*\*(Aq may be used only once\&. With UNIX groups or netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are allowed\&.
.PP
The
\fItimes\fR
field is used to indicate "when" these groups are to be given to the user\&. The format here is a logic list of day/time\-range entries\&. The days are specified by a sequence of two character entries, MoTuSa for example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday\&. Note that repeated days are unset MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all weekdays bar Monday\&. The two character combinations accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being week\-end days and all 7 days of the week respectively\&. As a final example, AlFr means all days except Friday\&.
.PP
Each day/time\-range can be prefixed with a \*(Aq!\*(Aq to indicate "anything but"\&. The time\-range part is two 24\-hour times HHMM, separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and finish time (if the finish time is smaller than the start time it is deemed to apply on the following day)\&.
.PP
The
\fIgroups\fR
field is a comma or space separated list of groups that the user inherits membership of\&. These groups are added if the previous fields are satisfied by the user\*(Aqs request\&.
.PP
For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be satisfied by the applying process\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
These are some example lines which might be specified in
/etc/security/group\&.conf\&.

.PP
Running \*(Aqxsh\*(Aq on tty* (any ttyXXX device), the users \*(Aqsword\*(Aq, \*(Aqpike\*(Aq and \*(Aqshield\*(Aq are given access to games (through membership of the floppy group) after work hours\&.
