pam_warn — PAM module which logs all PAM items if called

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_warn is a PAM module that logs the service, terminal, user, remote user and
remote host to syslog(3). The items are not probed for, but instead obtained
from the standard PAM items. The module always returns PAM_IGNORE, indicating
that it does not want to affect the authentication process.

OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.
