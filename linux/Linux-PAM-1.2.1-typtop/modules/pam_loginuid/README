pam_loginuid — Record user's login uid to the process attribute

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_loginuid module sets the loginuid process attribute for the process
that was authenticated. This is necessary for applications to be correctly
audited. This PAM module should only be used for entry point applications like:
login, sshd, gdm, vsftpd, crond and atd. There are probably other entry point
applications besides these. You should not use it for applications like sudo or
su as that defeats the purpose by changing the loginuid to the account they
just switched to.

EXAMPLES

#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     pam_unix.so
auth       required     pam_nologin.so
account    required     pam_unix.so
password   required     pam_unix.so
session    required     pam_unix.so
session    required     pam_loginuid.so
