pam_umask — PAM module to set the file mode creation mask

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_umask is a PAM module to set the file mode creation mask of the current
environment. The umask affects the default permissions assigned to newly
created files.

The PAM module tries to get the umask value from the following places in the
following order:

  • umask= argument

  • umask= entry in the user's GECOS field

  • UMASK= entry from /etc/default/login

  • UMASK entry from /etc/login.defs

The GECOS field is split on comma ',' characters. The module also in addition
to the umask= entry recognizes pri= entry, which sets the nice priority value
for the session, and ulimit= entry, which sets the maximum size of files the
processes in the session can create.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

silent

    Don't print informative messages.

usergroups

    If the user is not root and the username is the same as primary group name,
    the umask group bits are set to be the same as owner bits (examples: 022 ->
    002, 077 -> 007).

umask=mask

    Sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to mask & 0777.
    The value is interpreted as Octal.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to set the user specific umask at
login:

        session optional pam_umask.so umask=0022
