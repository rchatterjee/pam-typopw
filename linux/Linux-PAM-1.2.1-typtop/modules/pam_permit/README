pam_permit — The promiscuous module

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_permit is a PAM module that always permit access. It does nothing else.

In the case of authentication, the user's name will be set to nobody if the
application didn't set one. Many applications and PAM modules become confused
if this name is unknown.

This module is very dangerous. It should be used with extreme caution.

OPTIONS

This module does not recognise any options.

EXAMPLES

Add this line to your other login entries to disable account management, but
continue to permit users to log in.

account  required  pam_permit.so
