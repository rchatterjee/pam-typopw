pam_selinux — PAM module to set the default security context

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_selinux is a PAM module that sets up the default SELinux security context
for the next executed process.

When a new session is started, the open_session part of the module computes and
sets up the execution security context used for the next execve(2) call, the
file security context for the controlling terminal, and the security context
used for creating a new kernel keyring.

When the session is ended, the close_session part of the module restores old
security contexts that were in effect before the change made by the
open_session part of the module.

Adding pam_selinux into the PAM stack might disrupt behavior of other PAM
modules which execute applications. To avoid that, pam_selinux.so open should
be placed after such modules in the PAM stack, and pam_selinux.so close should
be placed before them. When such a placement is not feasible, pam_selinux.so
restore could be used to temporary restore original security contexts.

OPTIONS

open

    Only execute the open_session part of the module.

close

    Only execute the close_session part of the module.

restore

    In open_session part of the module, temporarily restore the security
    contexts as they were before the previous call of the module. Another call
    of this module without the restore option will set up the new security
    contexts again.

nottys

    Do not setup security context of the controlling terminal.

debug

    Turn on debug messages via syslog(3).

verbose

    Attempt to inform the user when security context is set.

select_context

    Attempt to ask the user for a custom security context role. If MLS is on,
    ask also for sensitivity level.

env_params

    Attempt to obtain a custom security context role from PAM environment. If
    MLS is on, obtain also sensitivity level. This option and the
    select_context option are mutually exclusive. The respective PAM
    environment variables are SELINUX_ROLE_REQUESTED, SELINUX_LEVEL_REQUESTED,
    and SELINUX_USE_CURRENT_RANGE. The first two variables are self describing
    and the last one if set to 1 makes the PAM module behave as if the
    use_current_range was specified on the command line of the module.

use_current_range

    Use the sensitivity level of the current process for the user context
    instead of the default level. Also suppresses asking of the sensitivity
    level from the user or obtaining it from PAM environment.

EXAMPLES

auth     required  pam_unix.so
session  required  pam_permit.so
session  optional  pam_selinux.so
