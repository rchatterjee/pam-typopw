pam_rhosts — The rhosts PAM module

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

This module performs the standard network authentication for services, as used
by traditional implementations of rlogin and rsh etc.

The authentication mechanism of this module is based on the contents of two
files; /etc/hosts.equiv (or and ~/.rhosts. Firstly, hosts listed in the former
file are treated as equivalent to the localhost. Secondly, entries in the
user's own copy of the latter file is used to map "remote-host remote-user"
pairs to that user's account on the current host. Access is granted to the user
if their host is present in /etc/hosts.equiv and their remote account is
identical to their local one, or if their remote account has an entry in their
personal configuration file.

The module authenticates a remote user (internally specified by the item
PAM_RUSER connecting from the remote host (internally specified by the item 
PAM_RHOST). Accordingly, for applications to be compatible this authentication
module they must set these items prior to calling pam_authenticate(). The
module is not capable of independently probing the network connection for such
information.
