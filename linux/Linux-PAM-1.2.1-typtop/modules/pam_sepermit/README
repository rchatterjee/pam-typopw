pam_sepermit — PAM module to allow/deny login depending on SELinux enforcement
state

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_sepermit module allows or denies login depending on SELinux enforcement
state.

When the user which is logging in matches an entry in the config file he is
allowed access only when the SELinux is in enforcing mode. Otherwise he is
denied access. For users not matching any entry in the config file the
pam_sepermit module returns PAM_IGNORE return value.

The config file contains a list of user names one per line with optional
arguments. If the name is prefixed with @ character it means that all users in
the group name match. If it is prefixed with a % character the SELinux user is
used to match against the name instead of the account name. Note that when
SELinux is disabled the SELinux user assigned to the account cannot be
determined. This means that such entries are never matched when SELinux is
disabled and pam_sepermit will return PAM_IGNORE.

See sepermit.conf(5) for details.
