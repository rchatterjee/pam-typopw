pam_filter — PAM filter module

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to be a platform for providing access to all of the
input/output that passes between the user and the application. It is only
suitable for tty-based and (stdin/stdout) applications.

To function this module requires filters to be installed on the system. The
single filter provided with the module simply transposes upper and lower case
letters in the input and output streams. (This can be very annoying and is not
kind to termcap based editors).

Each component of the module has the potential to invoke the desired filter.
The filter is always execv(2) with the privilege of the calling application and
not that of the user. For this reason it cannot usually be killed by the user
without closing their session.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

new_term

    The default action of the filter is to set the PAM_TTY item to indicate the
    terminal that the user is using to connect to the application. This
    argument indicates that the filter should set PAM_TTY to the filtered
    pseudo-terminal.

non_term

    don't try to set the PAM_TTY item.

runX

    In order that the module can invoke a filter it should know when to invoke
    it. This argument is required to tell the filter when to do this.

    Permitted values for X are 1 and 2. These indicate the precise time that
    the filter is to be run. To understand this concept it will be useful to
    have read the pam(3) manual page. Basically, for each management group
    there are up to two ways of calling the module's functions. In the case of
    the authentication and session components there are actually two separate
    functions. For the case of authentication, these functions are 
    pam_authenticate(3) and pam_setcred(3), here run1 means run the filter from
    the pam_authenticate function and run2 means run the filter from
    pam_setcred. In the case of the session modules, run1 implies that the
    filter is invoked at the pam_open_session(3) stage, and run2 for 
    pam_close_session(3).

    For the case of the account component. Either run1 or run2 may be used.

    For the case of the password component, run1 is used to indicate that the
    filter is run on the first occasion of pam_chauthtok(3) (the 
    PAM_PRELIM_CHECK phase) and run2 is used to indicate that the filter is run
    on the second occasion (the PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK phase).

filter

    The full pathname of the filter to be run and any command line arguments
    that the filter might expect.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to see how to configure login to
transpose upper and lower case letters once the user has logged in:

        session required pam_filter.so run1 /lib/security/pam_filter/upperLOWER
