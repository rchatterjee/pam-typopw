pam_time — PAM module for time control access

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead it
restricts access to a system and or specific applications at various times of
the day and on specific days or over various terminal lines. This module can be
configured to deny access to (individual) users based on their name, the time
of day, the day of week, the service they are applying for and their terminal
from which they are making their request.

By default rules for time/port access are taken from config file /etc/security/
time.conf.

If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it
denies access.

EXAMPLES

These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/
time.conf.

All users except for root are denied access to console-login at all times:

login ; tty* & !ttyp* ; !root ; !Al0000-2400


Games (configured to use PAM) are only to be accessed out of working hours.
This rule does not apply to the user waster:

games ; * ; !waster ; Wd0000-2400 | Wk1800-0800
