pam_issue — PAM module to add issue file to user prompt

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_issue is a PAM module to prepend an issue file to the username prompt. It
also by default parses escape codes in the issue file similar to some common
getty's (using \x format).

Recognized escapes:

\d

    current day

\l

    name of this tty

\m

    machine architecture (uname -m)

\n

    machine's network node hostname (uname -n)

\o

    domain name of this system

\r

    release number of operating system (uname -r)

\t

    current time

\s

    operating system name (uname -s)

\u

    number of users currently logged in

\U

    same as \u except it is suffixed with "user" or "users" (eg. "1 user" or
    "10 users")

\v

    operating system version and build date (uname -v)

OPTIONS

noesc

    Turns off escape code parsing.

issue=issue-file-name

    The file to output if not using the default.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to set the user specific issue at
login:

        auth optional pam_issue.so issue=/etc/issue
