pam_tty_audit — Enable or disable TTY auditing for specified users

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_tty_audit PAM module is used to enable or disable TTY auditing. By
default, the kernel does not audit input on any TTY.

OPTIONS

disable=patterns

    For each user matching one of comma-separated glob patterns, disable TTY
    auditing. This overrides any previous enable option matching the same user
    name on the command line.

enable=patterns

    For each user matching one of comma-separated glob patterns, enable TTY
    auditing. This overrides any previous disable option matching the same user
    name on the command line.

open_only

    Set the TTY audit flag when opening the session, but do not restore it when
    closing the session. Using this option is necessary for some services that
    don't fork() to run the authenticated session, such as sudo.

log_passwd

    Log keystrokes when ECHO mode is off but ICANON mode is active. This is the
    mode in which the tty is placed during password entry. By default,
    passwords are not logged. This option may not be available on older kernels
    (3.9?).

NOTES

When TTY auditing is enabled, it is inherited by all processes started by that
user. In particular, daemons restarted by an user will still have TTY auditing
enabled, and audit TTY input even by other users unless auditing for these
users is explicitly disabled. Therefore, it is recommended to use disable=* as
the first option for most daemons using PAM.

To view the data that was logged by the kernel to audit use the command 
aureport --tty.

EXAMPLES

Audit all administrative actions.

session required pam_tty_audit.so disable=* enable=root
