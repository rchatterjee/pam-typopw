pam_lastlog — PAM module to display date of last login and perform inactive
account lock out

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information about the last
login of the user. In addition, the module maintains the /var/log/lastlog file.

Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such cases, this
module is not necessary.

If the module is called in the auth or account phase, the accounts that were
not used recently enough will be disallowed to log in. The check is not
performed for the root account so the root is never locked out.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

silent

    Don't inform the user about any previous login, just update the /var/log/
    lastlog file.

never

    If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old entries for the user,
    indicate that the user has never previously logged in with a welcome
    message.

nodate

    Don't display the date of the last login.

noterm

    Don't display the terminal name on which the last login was attempted.

nohost

    Don't indicate from which host the last login was attempted.

nowtmp

    Don't update the wtmp entry.

noupdate

    Don't update any file.

showfailed

    Display number of failed login attempts and the date of the last failed
    attempt from btmp. The date is not displayed when nodate is specified.

inactive=<days>

    This option is specific for the auth or account phase. It specifies the
    number of days after the last login of the user when the user will be
    locked out by the module. The default value is 90.

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to display the last login time of an
user:

    session  required  pam_lastlog.so nowtmp


To reject the user if he did not login during the previous 50 days the
following line can be used:

    auth  required  pam_lastlog.so inactive=50
