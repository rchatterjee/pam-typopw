pam_echo — PAM module for printing text messages

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_echo PAM module is for printing text messages to inform user about
special things. Sequences starting with the % character are interpreted in the
following way:

%H

    The name of the remote host (PAM_RHOST).

%h

    The name of the local host.

%s

    The service name (PAM_SERVICE).

%t

    The name of the controlling terminal (PAM_TTY).

%U

    The remote user name (PAM_RUSER).

%u

    The local user name (PAM_USER).

All other sequences beginning with % expands to the characters following the %
character.

EXAMPLES

For an example of the use of this module, we show how it may be used to print
information about good passwords:

password optional pam_echo.so file=/usr/share/doc/good-password.txt
password required pam_unix.so
