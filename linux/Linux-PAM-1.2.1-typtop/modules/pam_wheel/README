pam_wheel — Only permit root access to members of group wheel

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_wheel PAM module is used to enforce the so-called wheel group. By
default it permits root access to the system if the applicant user is a member
of the wheel group. If no group with this name exist, the module is using the
group with the group-ID 0.

OPTIONS

debug

    Print debug information.

deny

    Reverse the sense of the auth operation: if the user is trying to get UID 0
    access and is a member of the wheel group (or the group of the group
    option), deny access. Conversely, if the user is not in the group, return
    PAM_IGNORE (unless trust was also specified, in which case we return
    PAM_SUCCESS).

group=name

    Instead of checking the wheel or GID 0 groups, use the name group to
    perform the authentication.

root_only

    The check for wheel membership is done only.

trust

    The pam_wheel module will return PAM_SUCCESS instead of PAM_IGNORE if the
    user is a member of the wheel group (thus with a little play stacking the
    modules the wheel members may be able to su to root without being prompted
    for a passwd).

use_uid

    The check for wheel membership will be done against the current uid instead
    of the original one (useful when jumping with su from one account to
    another for example).

EXAMPLES

The root account gains access by default (rootok), only wheel members can
become root (wheel) but Unix authenticate non-root applicants.

su      auth     sufficient     pam_rootok.so
su      auth     required       pam_wheel.so
su      auth     required       pam_unix.so
