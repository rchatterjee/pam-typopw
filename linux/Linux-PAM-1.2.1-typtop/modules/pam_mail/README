pam_mail — Inform about available mail

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

The pam_mail PAM module provides the "you have new mail" service to the user.
It can be plugged into any application that has credential or session hooks. It
gives a single message indicating the newness of any mail it finds in the
user's mail folder. This module also sets the PAM environment variable, MAIL,
to the user's mail directory.

If the mail spool file (be it /var/mail/$USER or a pathname given with the dir=
parameter) is a directory then pam_mail assumes it is in the Maildir format.

OPTIONS

close

    Indicate if the user has any mail also on logout.

debug

    Print debug information.

dir=maildir

    Look for the user's mail in an alternative location defined by maildir/
    <login>. The default location for mail is /var/mail/<login>. Note, if the
    supplied maildir is prefixed by a '~', the directory is interpreted as
    indicating a file in the user's home directory.

empty

    Also print message if user has no mail.

hash=count

    Mail directory hash depth. For example, a hashcount of 2 would make the
    mail file be /var/spool/mail/u/s/user.

noenv

    Do not set the MAIL environment variable.

nopen

    Don't print any mail information on login. This flag is useful to get the 
    MAIL environment variable set, but to not display any information about it.

quiet

    Only report when there is new mail.

standard

    Old style "You have..." format which doesn't show the mail spool being
    used. This also implies "empty".

EXAMPLES

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to indicate that the user has new
mail when they login to the system.

session  optional  pam_mail.so standard
