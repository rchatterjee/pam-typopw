pam_deny — The locking-out PAM module

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to deny access. It always indicates a failure to the
application through the PAM framework. It might be suitable for using for
default (the OTHER) entries.

EXAMPLES

#%PAM-1.0
#
# If we don't have config entries for a service, the
# OTHER entries are used. To be secure, warn and deny
# access to everything.

other account  required       pam_warn.so
