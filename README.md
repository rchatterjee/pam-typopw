## pam-typopw

This module tries to add typo tolerance to standard Unix password
based authentication systems. It uses Pluggable authentication module
(PAM) to plug typo tolerant password checking into services for which
the users wishes to avail the benefit, such as, normal login. 

I am still wokring on figuring out the details. 

### Requirements

Assuming you have `make` and `gcc`, additionally you have to
install the following libraries, 
>1. `libpam0g-dev`, for security/pam_modules.h etc.
>2. `libpam-python`, to write pam modules in Python. (Trust me much easier than C!)

Both of these can be installed using standard `apt-get`. (Though not
sure about non-debian world.)

<!--### How to? 
We have two implementation of this module--one in C and another in 
Python2.7. I shall explain them below in order.
 
#### C implementation
Compile the pam_module by running, `make`. If the compilation runs
good, you should get a shared library file named "pam_pwtypo.so".  We
shall explain how to add this pam module into action. First, lets do a
test run. 
```bash
$ sudo echo "auth requisite ${pwd}/pam_pwrypo.so" > /etc/pam.d/test 
$ python test_pam.py
```

If it asks for your login credentials, then you have correct
compilation of the `pam_pwtypo.so` module. Now, you just have to add
the line that you put inside `/etc/pam.d/test` file to the service
files (found in /etc/pam.d) where you wish to use typo tolerance. Add
the line before `pam_unix`.


#### Python implementation
-->
#### Install
Run `install.sh` to install. This will require super user permission.
```bash
$ sudo bash install.sh
```
This should install all the depenedencies and setup the PAM config files. Use `uninstall.sh` to uninstall the program. It might uninstall libraries that was previously installed but used by this. Please refer to the script (pretty small one) before running.

Also, this doesn't change your main login procedures. To enable typo-tolernace in all logins, add the following line to the top of your `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` file: `auth include test  # for allowing typo-tolerance`.
If you are happy with typo-tolernace, you can remove `/etc/pam.d/test`, and replace the above line with the the content of `/etc/pam.d/test`.  

**What if the typo-tolerance PAM module is buggy? Shall I be locked out?**   
No, your PAM should move onto next correct modules in common-auth, and you will be asked to reenter your credentials.   

Enjoy!


#### Issues
* To implement `mistypography` you have to install pwmodels, and make
  a symlink of `pwmodels/pwmodel/helper.py` in the `typofixer/` folder

### Architecural Decisions
1.  **How to transperantly move from existing system to the new
    authentication system?** At the time of installation make a copy of
    pasword database and populate it's own password entries.
2.  How to run a daemon for a small period of time? This is a program
    that stays alive for 30 sec from the last communication, or a
    successful password submission (whichever is earlier). The process
    communicates with the caller process via a unix socket.
